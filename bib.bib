abstract = {Since it was first published in 1995, Photonic Crystals has remained the definitive text for both undergraduates and researchers on photonic band-gap materials and their use in controlling the propagation of light. This newly expanded and revised edition covers the latest developments in the field, providing the most up-to-date, concise, and comprehensive book available on these novel materials and their applications. Starting from Maxwell's equations and Fourier analysis, the authors develop the theoretical tools of photonics using principles of linear algebra and symmetry, emphasizing analogies with traditional solid-state physics and quantum theory. They then investigate the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals at defect sites and surfaces, from one to three dimensions. This new edition includes entirely new chapters describing important hybrid structures that use band gaps or periodicity only in some directions: periodic waveguides, photonic-crystal slabs, and photonic-crystal fibers. The authors demonstrate how the capabilities of photonic crystals to localize light can be put to work in devices such as filters and splitters. A new appendix provides an overview of computational methods for electromagnetism. Existing chapters have been considerably updated and expanded to include many new three-dimensional photonic crystals, an extensive tutorial on device design using temporal coupled-mode theory, discussions of diffraction and refraction at crystal interfaces, and more. Richly illustrated and accessibly written, Photonic Crystals is an indispensable resource for students and researchers.Extensively revised and expanded Features improved graphics throughout Includes new chapters on photonic-crystal fibers and combined index-and band-gap-guiding Provides an introduction to coupled-mode theory as a powerful tool for device design Covers many new topics, including omnidirectional reflection, anomalous refraction and diffraction, computational photonics, and much more.}

abstract = {Optimal shape design of structural elements based on boundary variations results in final designs that are topologically equivalent to the initial choice of design, and general, stable computational schemes for this approach often require some kind of remeshing of the finite element approximation of the analysis problem. This paper presents a methodology for optimal shape design where both these drawbacks can be avoided. The method is related to modern production techniques and consists of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic material that is constructed by introducing an infimum of periodically distributed small holes in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting structure can carry the given loads as well as satisfy other design requirements. The computation of effective material properties for the anisotropic material is carried out using the method of homogenization. Computational results are presented and compared with results obtained by boundary variations.}

    abstract = {A male Morpho peleides butterfly wing is decorated by two types of scales, cover and ground scales. We have studied the optical properties of each type of scales in conjunction with the structural information provided by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and computer simulation. The shining blue color is mainly from the Bragg reflection of the one-dimensional photonic structure, e.g., the shelf structure packed regularly in each ridges on cover scales. A thin-film-like interference effect from the base plate of the cover scale enhances such blue color and further gives extra reflection peaks in the infrared and ultraviolet regions. The analogy in the spectra acquired from the original wing and that from the cover scales suggests that the cover scales take a dominant role in its structural color. This study provides insight of using the biotemplates for fabricating smart photonic structures.},

The optimization targets the fundamental mode which is more easily identified in physical experiments compared to high-order modes embedded in possibly dense frequency ranges. Both intrinsic and extrinsic losses are considered in the optimization process. With different combinations of the two damping sources, topology optimization yields distinct designs, which reveals that damping mechanisms significantly affect the optimal geometry of micro resonators. For optimized designs, the Qf in the fundamental mode exceeds the minimum requirement for room-temperature quantum optomechanics (6.2×1012 Hz) and reaches 1013 Hz in numerical experiments.",

Traditionally, the improvement of the resonator{\textquoteright}s performance through nanomechanical structural engineering has been driven by human intuition and insight. Such an approach is inefficient and leaves aside a plethora of unexplored mechanical designs that potentially achieve better performance. Here, we use a computer-aided inverse design approach known as topology optimization to structurally design mechanical resonators with optimized performance of the fundamental mechanical mode. Using the outcomes of this approach, we fabricate and characterize ultra-coherent nanomechanical resonators with, to the best of our knowledge, record-high Q ⋅ f products for their fundamental mode (where Q is the quality factor and f is the frequency). The proposed approach - which can also be used to improve phononic crystals and coupled-mode resonators - opens up a new paradigm for designing ultra-coherent micro- and nanomechanical resonators, enabling e.g. novel experiments in fundamental physics and extreme sensing.",

abstract = {We design a resistive heater optimized for efficient and low-loss optical phase modulation in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide and characterize the fabricated devices. Modulation is achieved by flowing current perpendicular to a new ridge waveguide geometry. The resistance profile is engineered using different dopant concentrations to obtain localized heat generation and maximize the overlap between the optical mode and the high temperature regions of the structure, while simultaneously minimizing optical loss due to free-carrier absorption. A 61.6 $\mu$m long phase shifter was fabricated in a CMOS process with oxide cladding and two metal layers. The device features a phase-shifting efficiency of 24.77 {\textpm} 0.43 mW/$\pi$ and a {\textminus}3 dB modulation bandwidth of 130.0 {\textpm} 5.59 kHz; the insertion loss measured for 21 devices across an 8-inch wafer was only 0.23 {\textpm} 0.13 dB. Considering the prospect of densely integrated photonic circuits, we also quantify the separation necessary to isolate thermo-optic devices in the standard 220 nm SOI platform.},

	abstract = {Topology optimization has been regarded as a powerful design approach for determining optimal topology of a structure to obtain desired functional performances within a defined design domain. Considering manufacturing process constraints in topology optimization becomes increasingly important due to its potential practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel topology optimization model with manufacturing process related connectivity constraints. A generalized method, named as virtual scalar field method (VSFM), is developed for describing and enforcing desired connectivity constraint. As an illustrative example, the connectivity constraint can be converted to an equivalent maximum temperature constraint when temperature is chosen as the scalar field. The temperature constraint is then easily integrated and implemented in routine topology optimization. The simply-connected constraint, which excludes interior closed cavities and is representative of many advanced manufacturing techniques, e.g. additive manufacturing (AM) or casting, is used as an example to demonstrate the key ideas and the efficiency of the VSF method. Some numerical examples, which consider the connectivity constraint in topology optimization, are presented to show the validity of this method.},
