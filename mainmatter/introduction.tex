\chapter{Introduction}
Nanophotonic devices are key building blocks in emerging technologies such as on-chip lasers, high-speed modulators, and quantum photonic platforms. 
These systems must operate reliably under real-world conditions: lasers must manage thermal and electrical effects, modulators must respond efficiently 
to electrical or thermal signals, and quantum devices must carefully mitigate (or utilize) mechanical and electromagnetic phenomena. In all these cases, device 
performance arises from the interaction of multiple physical domains, including electromagnetism, heat transfer, mechanics, and carrier dynamics.

Despite this inherently multiphysics nature, most current design approaches treat these effects in isolation or overlook them entirely. Designs are typically optimized 
for idealized optical performance, while non-optical effects are considered only a posteriori,
often resulting in suboptimal or unstable devices. This gap between idealized design models and real-world device behavior limits the scalability and robustness of current nanophotonic technologies.

One reason for this limitation is that conventional design methods rely on well-established, single-physics models (e.g., photonic crystals and waveguides), while the full multiphysics problem remains computationally challenging.
However, when thermal, mechanical, or electrical effects strongly influence the optical response, neglecting them in the design phase can compromise overall device performance.

This Ph.D. project aims to address these challenges by developing and applying multiphysics topology optimization methods for nanophotonic device design. These methods enable the simultaneous treatment of coupled physical effects, 
allowing for the automated discovery of device geometries that are not only optically efficient but also account for and utilize thermal, mechanical, and electrical effects. Beyond improving device reliability, this approach can reveal 
novel design principles and physical phenomena that emerge only when multiple physics are considered simultaneously.

\section{Multiphysics effects in nanophotonics}\label{intro:multi}

Multiphysics effects play a crucial role not only in advanced nanophotonic technologies but are also abundant in nature, where the interplay of optics with mechanics, thermodynamics, and chemistry creates dynamic and functional nano-optical systems.

As shown in \figref{fig:motivation_natural}, nature provides colourful examples of such multiphysics interactions. For instance, \textit{Morpho peleides} butterfly wings exhibit structural coloration caused by light interacting with nanoscale photonic structures in the wing scales~\cite{butterfly}. This coloration dynamically changes with mechanical deformation of the wings, variations in the angle of light incidence, and environmental factors such as humidity and temperature~\cite{morpho_temp}, which alter the physical properties of the nanostructures. 
Another striking example is the soap bubble, where iridiscent colors arise from thin-film interference effects within the nanoscale thickness of the soap film. The bubble's color shifts as the film thickness changes due to fluid flow, mechanical stresses, evaporation (linked to temperature changes), and chemical composition variations~\cite{bubble}, demonstrating strong coupling between fluid dynamics, thermal and chemical dynamics, and optics.

In engineered nanophotonics, multiphysic couplings are fundamental to various key applications. From photonic integrated circuits that tune light through  
thermo-optic~\cite{TOPS_1, TOPS_2, TOPS_3, program, PIC} and electro-optic~\cite{modu, modu1, modu2, pockels} effects, to nanolasers that balance optical gain, carrier dynamics, and heat dissipation~\cite{laser,laser_pic}, multiphysics couplings enable stable, efficient on-chip light manipulation. Equally, sensors  
push sensitivity limits by coupling electromagnetic fields with mechanical motion, thermal gradients, or chemical environments, to achieve unprecedented sensitivities \cite{therm_sensing,sensing, weakforce}.
Precise optomechanical manipulation, whether trapping nanoparticles~\cite{ashkin_acceleration_1970} or actuating tiny structures with light~\cite{ivanyi_optically_2024}, further illustrates how forces and electromagnetic fields work together at the nanoscale. Quantum photonic devices 
also leverage electrical, mechanical, and thermal effects to preserve quantum coherence, or achieve robust state manipulation~\cite{quant_eo, Andrews_2014, Xi_2025}. Bridging these advances, nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems (NOEMS)~\cite{NOEMS} uniquely integrate all these  
domains, allowing electrical actuation, mechanical motion, and optical response to coexist in ultra-compact, reconfigurable platforms.

\section{Topology optimization in nanophotonics}\label{intro:to}

As illustrated by the examples in the previous sections, ingeniously engineered nanostructures and material properties play a crucial role in the
optical response of a system. Inspired by these natural structures, an overarching goal of nanophotonic
design is to optimize the geometry and material properties of the system to achieve a target
optical response.

\textbf{Topology optimization}~\cite{topopt_book} is a systematic inverse design method that effectively addresses this challenge. It finds the optimal distribution of material within a given design domain to maximize a target performance metric,
 known as the objective function or \textbf{figure of merit (FOM)}, while satisfying a set of constraints. This method
was pioneered in the field of structural mechanics by Bends√∏e and Kikuchi~\cite{bendsoe_kikukchi}, 
and has since been extended to various fields, including fluids~\cite{topopt_fluid}, acoustics~\cite{topopt_acoustic}, 
electromagnetics~\cite{topopt_EM}, (nano)photonics~\cite{topopt_phot}, and multiphysics problems (\secref{sec:topopt_theory})~\cite{coupled_topopt}. In this thesis, we focus on the application of density-based~\cite{bendsoe_density, topopt_approaches} 
topology optimization in multiphysics nanophotonics and nano-optics problems~\cite{jensen_review}.

\textbf{Density-based topology optimization} describes the distribution of materials within a design space using a 
density\footnote{Note that this \emph{density} is not a density in the physical sense of the word but rather a design field used in topology optimization.} field $\rho(\mathbf{r}) \in [0,1]$, where $\rho = 0$ corresponds to one material, typically air or void, and $\rho = 1$ corresponds to a solid material.
 As illustrated 
in \autoref{fig:top_opt} for a nanophotonic system, the objective is to optimize the arrangement of these materials within 
the design domain to achieve a desired performance (e.g. maximizing transmission, reflection, absorption) when illuminated by a light source, such as a laser beam, an LED, or a focused light beam. 
The structure consists of passive regions, where the material remains fixed (e.g., void), and design regions, where the material distribution 
is optimized. The optimization process iteratively updates the density field until FOM is maximized or minimized, and the targeted optical response is achieved.
