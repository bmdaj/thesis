Current state-of-the-art design approaches for photonic devices often rely on trial-and-error
experience-based multi-stage approaches using simplified physics models for individual
components. This may in part be due to the extensively developed and well-understood models
for the temporal and spatial confinement of light in pure photonic structures, such as photonic
crystals and waveguides, and in part due to the complexity of the full physics problems. Further, such design approaches often ignore multi-physics effects, such as . If these
effects are strong, and simultaneously have a large influence on the optical field, their omission in
the design process may lead to a suboptimal final device.

This Ph.D. project aims to address these challenges by employing novel
multi-physics design optimization techniques, which accurately capture 
the important effects of the full physics problem.

\section{Multiphysics effects in nano-optics}

RECHECK THAT EVERYTHING HERE IS CORRECT AND MAKES SENSE. 

Nature offers a wide range of examples of nano-optical systems that exhibit 
multi-physics effects, see Figure 1.
For example, the wings of the butterfly exhibit structural coloration due to the
 interaction of light 
with nanostructures in the wing scales. The color of the wings can change due to
 mechanical motion, where the angle of incidence of light changes.
The opal is another example of a natural nano-optical system, where the color of the opal
changes due to the periodic structure of the crystal. The color of the opal can change
due to the angle of incidence of light, or due to temperature changes in the evironment, 
which can result in evaporation, changing the spacing between the crystal planes.
Another example of a nano-optical system is the soap bubble, where the color of the bubble
changes due to the varying thickness of the bubble. The color of the bubble can change due to
mechanical stresses, evaporation due to temperature changes, or due to the chemical composition
of the bubble.
%butterfly example, chameleon, firefly bioluminesce with heat, opal iridescence (change with heat/water).
%Soap bubles, they will change color when through mechanical stresses, evaporation due to temperature changes, chemical composition, etc.

\section{Topology optimization in nano-optics}

As seen by the examples in Figure 1, nano-optical systems exhibit multi-physics effects,
where ingenously engineered geometry and material properties play a crucial role in the
optical response of the system. Inspired by these natural structures a goal of nano-optics
design is to optimize the geometry and material properties of the system to achieve a desired
optical response. Topology optimization offers a systematic approach to optimize the geometry
and material properties of a system to obtain a desired optical performance under a set of constraints.

Topology optimization is a systematic design method that can optimize designs based on a target FOM and a set of constraints. 
Say that it was introduced in the field of mechanics (CITE BENDSOE), but then it was extended to 
nano-optic and nanphotonic systems (CITE JENSEN, SIGMUND).

In Figure XX we we show an example of a topology optimziation problem in nano-optics. The 
main idea is two optimize the distribution of material in the design domain for two different materials, 
where the material distribution is optimized to maximize a FOM. ADD SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOURCE.
