\section{Modeling optical systems -- an electromagnetic wave problem}

\subsection*{The macroscopic Maxwell's equations}

Macroscopic electromagnetic systems can be described by Maxwell's equations. The time-domain Maxwell's equations in a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous medium can be written as
\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} (\mathbf{r},t) &= - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}, \quad \quad &\text{(Faraday's law)} \label{eq:curlE_time}\\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{H} (\mathbf{r},t) &= \varepsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} + \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r},t), \quad \quad &\text{(Ampère's law)} \label{eq:curlH_time}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} (\mathbf{r},t) &= \rho(\mathbf{r},t), \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for electricity)} \label{eq:divD_time}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} (\mathbf{r},t) &= 0, \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for magnetism)} \label{eq:divB_time}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, 
$\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}$ is the electric displacement field, 
$\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic induction field, 
$\varepsilon$ is the permittivity, and $\mu$ is the permeability.

Give an explanation of Maxwell's equations. Perhaps with some bullet points?

In the presence of polarization $\mathbf{P}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, 
the fields $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are related to $\mathbf{E}$ and 
$\mathbf{H}$ by the following equations:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) + \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{r}, t), \\
    \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \mu_0^{-1} \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) - \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{r}, t),
\end{align}
where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

Using Maxwell's equations and applying the curl operator to Faraday's law and Ampère's law, 
together with the definition of the polarization and magnetization,
we can derive the wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    & \nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{E}+\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}=-\mu_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\mathbf{j}+\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t}+\nabla \times \mathbf{M}\right), \\
    & \nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf{H}+\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{H}}{\partial t^2}=\nabla \times \mathbf{j}+\nabla \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t}-\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{M}}{\partial t^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c=(\varepsilon_0 \mu_0)^{-1/2}$ is the speed of light in vacuum.

Note that this mascroscopic fields in Maxwell's equations are spatial averages of the
microscopic fields, and the charge and current densities are continous in space and time.
For an atomic scale description of the electromagnetic fields, one can use the microscopic
Maxwell's equations, which include a description of matter based on discrete charged particles
(e.g., electrons, protons, etc.).

\subsection*{Electromagnetics in the frequency domain}

The time-dependence in Maxwell's equations can be separated by assuming a harmonic time-dependence of the fields:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \Re \{ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\omega t} \} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) e^{i\omega t} + \mathbf{E}^*(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\omega t}\right], \label{eq:E_harmonic}\\
\end{equation}

Then, the time-domain Maxwell's equations can be written as

\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -i\omega \mu \mathbf{H}, \quad \quad &\text{(Faraday's law)} \label{eq:curlE_freq}\\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{H} &= i\omega \varepsilon \mathbf{E}, \quad \quad &\text{(Ampère's law)} \label{eq:curlH_freq}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} &= 0, \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for electricity)} \label{eq:divD_freq}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0, \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for magnetism)} \label{eq:divB_freq}
\end{align}

WRITE WAVE EQUATION, CHECK PHOTONIC CRYSTAL BOOK TOO (EQ. 7). USE AN OPERATOR LIKE STEVEN? 
THIS CAN BE USED TO TALK ABOUT THE MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES OF THE OPERATOR.

\subsection*{Boundary conditions at material interfaces}

In many physical systems, and specially in computational optics, the medium can be divided
into different regions with different material properties. Although a piecewise homogeneous
medium is an inhomoegeneous medium, the inhomogeneities are confined to the boundaries and 
the optical problem can be solved in each region separately. The solutions to the optical problems
are connected by the boundary conditions at the interfaces between the regions; and thus between
materials. These boundary conditions can be derived from Maxwell's equations, and for a boundary
$\Gamma_{ij}$ separating domain $i$ from domain $j$ yield the tangential field conditions:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{E}_i - \mathbf{E}_j) &= 0 \label{eq:BC_E}\\
    \mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{H}_i - \mathbf{H}_j) &= \mathbf{K} , \label{eq:BC_H}
\end{align} 
and the normal field conditions:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{D}_i - \mathbf{D}_j) &= \rho_s \label{eq:BC_D}\\
    \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{B}_i - \mathbf{B}_j) &= 0, \label{eq:BC_B}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the normal vector to the boundary, $\mathbf{K}$ is the surface current density,
 and $\rho_s$ is the surface charge density. Note that In many optical problems there are no 
 sources in the individual domains, and $\mathbf{K}$ and $\rho$ are zero.

Linearity, hermitian operator (can be related to recirpocity too), superposition, 
conservation laws (charge, energy, momentum), time-reversal symmetry/recirpocity
self-adjointness, duality symmetry ...

positive semi-definite. Therefore all of the eigenvalues are nonnegative, and is real. Can
be relate to solver choice later.

\section{The finite element method in electromagnetics}

(CHECK IANS THESIS)

The weak form of the wave equation can be written as (CHECK CHATGPT):
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} \nabla \times \mathbf{E} \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf{v} - k^2 \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{v} \quad \forall \mathbf{v} \in V,
\end{equation}
The weak form can be discretized by using the finite-element method. An example is shown in Figure YY, 
where we have discretized the two-dimensional domain in Figure XX into a set of triangular edge elements. 
The edge elements, or Nedelec elements (CITE), of first kind are a natural choice for the electromagnetic 
wave equation, as they are divergence-free and enforce the continuity of the tangential electric field 
across the element boundaries, which is a natural boundary condition for Maxwell's equations 
\footnote{For 2D models where the field discontinuity at the material interfaces 
is in the out-of-plane direction (e.g., Publication 3), one can use Lagrange element without 
exciting spurious modes.}. In Figure YY
we show the structure of a Nedelec element alongside a quiver plot of the shape function one of the edges.
Using the shape functions we can calculate the contribution of the different elements to the weak form of the
wave equation, which can be assembled into a system of equations in the strong form:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{K} \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{F},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{K}$ is the stiffness matrix, $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the source
 term. In the case of eigenvalue problems the source term is zero ($\mathbf{F}=0$), and the system of equations 
that needs to be solved is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \left(\mathbf{K} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right) \mathbf{E} =  \mathbf{0},
\end{equation}

Note that the stiffness matrix is symmetric indefinite, restricting the use of iterative solvers (e.g., Cholesky factorization, Krylov method) to solve the system of equations. Instead LU factorization is a common choice for direct solvers.

\section{Beyond single-physics -- coupled optical systems}

Coupled multi-physics systems are physical systems where the solution of one of the physical 
problem depends on the solution of another physical problem. Let's consider that the two
problems can be described by linear partial differential equations, where the first problem
is described by the equation $\mathcal{L}_1 [\mathbf{u}]= \mathbf{a}$ and the second problem is described by the 
equation $\mathcal{L}_2 [\mathbf{w}]= \mathbf{b}$.

 If this relation is unidirectional
we call it \textbf{weak coupling}, and if the relation is bidirectional we call it 
\textbf{strong coupling}.

In weaky coupled systems, both physical problems can be solved independently in a seggregated 
manner, where the solution of one problem is used in the the other problem.

In strongly coupled systems, the physical problems are solved simultaneously.

Differentiate between weak and strong coupling.
