\chapter{Theoretical framework}

This chapter covers the theoretical foundations to understand the contents of this thesis, 
and is divided in four main sections. The first section presents the fundamental physics
governing optical problems, in the singlek physics picture. The second section provides 
an introduction to solving optical problems numerically using the finite-element method.
The third section introduces the concept of coupled optical systems, in the multi-physics
picture. The fourth section discusses the topology optimization of multi-physics systems.
With these tools we can understand how to solve the inverse design problems in the following
chapter.

\section{Nano-optics -- Light as an electromagnetic wave}

In classical optics, light is treated as an electromagnetic (EM) wave, which can be described by 
solving Maxwell's equations. Solving these partial differential equations can be complicated, and 
depending on the characteristic size ($s$) of objects compared to the light's wavelength ($\lambda$) 
simpler limiting cases can be used to describe optical phenomena:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ray Optics ($s \ll \lambda$):} When objects are much larger than the wavelength, light is modeled as straight-line rays.
    \item \textbf{Quasistatics \& lumped circuit models ($s \gg \lambda$):} When objects are much smaller than the wavelength, the wave natue of light dissapears, 
    and can be approximated quasistatically (i.e., solving Poisson's equation). For instance, electronic devices can be modeled in this regime using circuit models w
    ith lumped elements, like resistors or capacitors. 
\end{itemize}
In the fields of photonics and \emph{nano-optics}, where the visible 
(\(\lambda \sim 400\)--\(800\) nm) and infrared (\(\lambda \sim 800\)--\(2500\) nm)
 spectral regions are most commonly explored, components often have nano- to
  microscale dimensions. As a result, we are in the \textbf{wave-optics} regime ($\lambda \sim s$ ),  
  where we cannot resort to simpler models like ray optics or quasistatic/lumped circuits models,
  and instead need to solve Maxwell's equations. Given the complexity of Maxwell's
  equations very few problems (e.g., problems with high symmetry, separability, few parameters) 
  can be solved analytically and for most problems requires 
  numerical solutions (e.g., the finite element method).


\subsection*{The macroscopic Maxwell's equations}

Light propagation in a \emph{macroscopic} electromagnetic systems can be described by Maxwell's equations. The time-domain Maxwell's 
equations in a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous medium can be written as:

\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}} (\mathbf{r},t) &= - \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{B}}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}, \quad \quad &\text{(Faraday's law)} \label{eq:faraday}\\
    \nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}} (\mathbf{r},t) &= \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{D}}(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} + \bm{\mathcal{J}}(\mathbf{r},t), \quad \quad &\text{(Ampère's law)} \label{eq:ampere}\\
    \nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{D}} (\mathbf{r},t) &= \mathcal{\rho}(\mathbf{r},t), \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for electricity)} \label{eq:gauss_E}\\
    \nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{B}} (\mathbf{r},t) &= 0, \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for magnetism)} \label{eq:Gauss_B}
\end{align}
where $\bm{\mathcal{E}}$ and $\bm{\mathcal{H}}$ are the time-dependent electric and magnetic (induction) fields, respectively, 
$\bm{\mathcal{D}}$ is the time-dependent electric displacement field,  
$\bm{\mathcal{B}}$ is the time-dependent magnetic (flux-density) field, $\bm{\mathcal{J}}$ is the current density,
and $\mathcal{\rho}$ is the time-dependent charge density. Maxwell's equations combine previously established
physical laws, in 4 equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Faraday's law} [Eq.~\eqref{eq:faraday}] describes how a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field.
    \item \textbf{Ampère's law} [Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampere}] describes how a time-varying electric field and electric current density induce a magnetic field.
    \item \textbf{Gauss's law for electricity} [Eq.~\eqref{eq:gauss_E}] describes how electric charges create an electric field. 
    \item \textbf{Gauss's law for magnetism} [Eq.~\eqref{eq:Gauss_B}] states that there are no magnetic monopoles, and thus the magnetic field lines are closed loops.
\end{itemize}

Note that the mascroscopic fields in Maxwell's equations 
are spatial averages of the
microscopic fields, and the charge and current densities are continous in space and time.
For an atomic scale description of the electromagnetic fields, one can use the \emph{microscopic}
Maxwell's equations, which include a quantized description of matter based on discrete charged particles
(e.g., electrons, protons, etc.), and currents.\\

To understand how materials respond to electromagnetic fields,
we need to introduce the constitutive equations. These materials can be modeled
with the presence of a time-dependent polarization $\bm{\mathcal{P}}$ and magnetization $\bm{\mathcal{M}}$, 
which relate the fields $\bm{\mathcal{D}}$ and $\bm{\mathcal{B}}$ to the fields $\bm{\mathcal{E}}$ and 
$\bm{\mathcal{H}}$ by the constitutive equations:
\begin{align}
    \bm{\mathcal{D}}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \varepsilon_0 \bm{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbf{r}, t) + \bm{\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{r}, t), \label{eq:D}\\ 
    \bm{\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \mu_0^{-1} \bm{\mathcal{B}}(\mathbf{r}, t) - \bm{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{r}, t) \label{eq:H},
\end{align}
where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. 
note that the polarization and magnetization also depend on the electric and magnetic fields; as an example the
polarization can be written as a series expansion in powers of the electric field: 
$\bm{\mathcal{P}}=\mathcal{\varepsilon}_0 \bm{\mathcal{\chi}}^{(1)} \bm{\mathcal{E}}+\mathcal{\varepsilon}_0 \bm{\mathcal{\chi}}^{(2)} \bm{\mathcal{E}} \bm{\mathcal{E}}+\mathcal{\varepsilon}_0 \bm{\mathcal{\chi}}^{(3)} \bm{\mathcal{E}} \bm{\mathcal{E}} \bm{\mathcal{E}}+\cdots$,
where $\bm{\mathcal{\chi}}^{n}$ is the $n^\text{th}$ order component of the electric susceptibility. In this thesis
we will only consider linear materials, where only the first-order terms in the expansion are considered. \\


Using Maxwell's equations and applying the curl operator to Faraday's law [Eq.~\eqref{eq:faraday}] and Ampère's law [Eq.~\eqref{eq:ampere}], 
together with the constitutive relations for $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:D} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:H}, one gets two coupled
wave equations for the electric and magnetic fields:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    & \nabla \times \nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}}+\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \bm{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t^2}=-\mu_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\bm{\mathcal{J}}+\frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{P}}}{\partial t}+\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{M}}\right), \\
    & \nabla \times \nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}}+\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \bm{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial t^2}=\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{J}}+\nabla \times \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{P}}}{\partial t}-\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \bm{\mathcal{M}}}{\partial t^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c=(\varepsilon_0 \mu_0)^{-1/2}$ is the speed of light in vacuum. This equation described the wave nature of electromagnetic fields,
and is generally valid for any material.

\subsection*{Electromagnetics in the frequency domain}

The time-dependence in Maxwell's equations can be separated by assuming a harmonic time-dependence of the fields:
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \Re \{ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\omega t} \}= \frac{1}{2}\left[ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) e^{i\omega t} + \mathbf{E}^*(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\omega t}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{E}$ is the complex field phasor, $\omega=ck$ is the angular frequency of the light, and $k=2\pi/\lambda$ is the wavenumber.
Using this complex field, the time-domain Maxwell's equations can be written as
\begin{align}
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) &= -i\omega \mathbf{B}(\omega, \mathbf{r}), \quad \quad &\text{(Faraday's law)} \label{eq:curlE_freq}\\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}) &= i\omega  \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}), \quad \quad &\text{(Ampère's law)} \label{eq:curlH_freq}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}) &= \rho(\mathbf{r}), \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for electricity)} \label{eq:divD_freq}\\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) &= 0, \quad \quad &\text{(Gauss's law for magnetism)} \label{eq:divB_freq}
\end{align}

where all fields now are complex phasors that also depend on the frequency
(e.g., $\mathbf{E}(\omega, \mathbf{r})$) and only have spatial dependence. In a similar fashion,
the material parameters are complex functions of space and frequency (e.g., $\varepsilon(\omega, \mathbf{r}$)). 
Note that the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations are equivalent to applying Fourier transform in time to the time domain
equations [Eqs.~\eqref{eq:faraday}-\eqref{eq:Gauss_B}].\\

By using the frequency-domain constitutive relations and applying the curl operator to Faraday's law [Eq.~\eqref{eq:curlE_freq}] and Ampère's law [Eq.~\eqref{eq:curlH_freq}],
we can combine both equations into a single wave equation for the electric field\footnote{A similar procedure one can be applied to derive a wave equation for the magnetic field.
}:

\begin{equation}
    \nabla \times \left(\frac{1}{\mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{E}\right) - k^2 \varepsilon \mathbf{E} = -i\omega \mu \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r})\,. 
\end{equation}
This is the Helmholtz equation for the electric field. This equation can 
be further simplified by adopting an operator nomenclature:
\begin{empheq}[box={\fboxsep=5pt\fboxrule=0.5pt\fbox}]{equation}\label{eq:helmholtz}
    \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})] = \mathbf{f}\,,
\end{empheq}
where $\mathcal{L} \triangleq \nabla \times \left[(1/\mu) \nabla \times \mathbf{\square} \right] - k^2 \square $ is a differential operator acting on a vector field $\mathbf{\square}$, 
and $\mathbf{f} = -i\omega \mu \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r})$ is the source term. This equation is the cornerstone of the numerical analysis in this thesis.

\subsection*{Boundary conditions at material interfaces}

In many physical systems, and specially in computational optics, the medium can be divided
into different regions with different material properties. Although a piecewise homogeneous
medium is an inhomoegeneous medium, the inhomogeneities are confined to the boundaries and 
the optical problem can be solved in each region separately. The solutions to the optical problems
are connected by the boundary conditions at the interfaces between the regions; and thus between
materials. These boundary conditions can be derived from Maxwell's equations, and for a boundary
$\Gamma_{ij}$ separating domain $i$ from domain $j$ yield the tangential field conditions:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{E}_i - \mathbf{E}_j) &= 0 \label{eq:BC_E}\\
    \mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{H}_i - \mathbf{H}_j) &= \mathbf{K} , \label{eq:BC_H}
\end{align} 
and the normal field conditions:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{D}_i - \mathbf{D}_j) &= \rho_s \label{eq:BC_D}\\
    \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{B}_i - \mathbf{B}_j) &= 0, \label{eq:BC_B}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the normal vector to the boundary, $\mathbf{K}$ is the surface current density,
 and $\rho_s$ is the surface charge density. Note that In many optical problems there are no 
 sources in the individual domains, and $\mathbf{K}$ and $\rho$ are zero.

\subsection*{Modeling single emitters: the Green's function formalism}

\subsection*{Some useful properties of Maxwell's equations}
The following are some key properties of Maxwell's equations and the Helmholtz operator that will be useful throughout this thesis.:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linearity and superposition:} The operator introduced in Eq.~\eqref{eq:helmholtz} is linear, meaning the superposition principle holds. If $\mathbf{E}_1$ and $\mathbf{E}_2$ are t
    wo solutions to the Helmholtz equation, such that $\mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_1] = \mathbf{f}_1$ and 
    $\mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_2] = \mathbf{f}_2$, then their linear combination ($\mathbf{E}_3 = \alpha \mathbf{E}_1 + \beta \mathbf{E}_2$) 
    is also a solution:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_3] = \mathcal{L}[\alpha \mathbf{E}_1 + \beta \mathbf{E}_2] = \alpha \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_1] + \beta \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_2] = \alpha \mathbf{f}_1 + \beta \mathbf{f}_2 = \mathbf{f}_3\,.
    \end{equation}
    For instance, if the source term is scaled by a proportionality factor, the resulting field solution will also be scaled by the same factor, maintaining the proportional relationship. 

    \item \textbf{Hermiticity:} The operator $\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint, meaning that the inner product of two solutions is invariant under the operator:
    \begin{equation}
        \int \mathbf{E}_1^* \cdot \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_2] \d \mathbf{r} = \int \mathcal{L}[\mathbf{E}_1]^* \cdot \mathbf{E}_2 \d \mathbf{r}\,,
    \end{equation}
    This property ensures that purely real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenmodes\footnote{Except for degenerate eigenmodes, which will not necessarily be orthogonal.}, as shown in \cite{phot_crys}. Moreover,
    one can show that the operator is \textbf{positive semi-definitive}, meaning that all eigenvalues ($k^2$) are non-negative. Since all eigenvalues are real and non-negative, the operator $\mathcal{L}$ is \textbf{diagonalizable}.
    RELATE TO SOLVER CHOICE LATER.
    
    \item \textbf{Scale-invariance:} The Helmholtz operator $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{r})$ is invariant under a change of scale. 
    If $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is a solution to the Helmholtz equation for the frequency $\omega$, then $\mathbf{E}(\alpha \mathbf{r})$ 
    is also a solution for any scaling factor $\alpha$, given a constant
     dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon(\omega, \mathbf{r}) = \varepsilon (\omega^\prime, \alpha \mathbf{r})$ at a frequency $\omega^\prime = \alpha \omega$ \cite{phot_crys}. Similarly,
     if we scale the dielectric permittivity by a value $\alpha$ the electric field distribution is constant when working at a re-scaled version of the 
     frequency $\omega^\prime=\omega/\alpha $ \cite{phot_crys}.
    In other words, as long as the permittivity is constant under spatial transformations, there is no fundamental lengthscale or dielectric permittivity  
    values in mascroscopic electromagnetic systems. Note however, that in general the dielectric permittivity is a function of the frequency $\varepsilon(\omega)\neq \varepsilon(\omega^\prime)$, 
    breaking scale-invariance.
    
    \item \textbf{Conservation laws:} Maxwell's equations inherently satisfy several conservation laws, which are fundamental to physical systems MAKE SURE OF THE SYMBOLS AND EQUATIONS THEY ARE TIME-DOMAIN:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Charge conservation:} The continuity equation ensures that charge is conserved in the system:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0.
        \end{equation}
        This equation relates the divergence of the current density $\mathbf{J}$ to the time rate of change of the charge density $\rho$.

        \item \textbf{Energy conservation:} The Poynting theorem describes the conservation of electromagnetic energy:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E},
        \end{equation}
        where $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}$ is the Poynting vector representing the energy flux, and $u = (1/2) (\varepsilon |\mathbf{E}|^2 + \mu |\mathbf{H}|^2)$ is the electromagnetic energy density.

        \item \textbf{Momentum conservation:} The electromagnetic fields carry momentum, and the conservation of momentum is described by the Maxwell stress tensor $\mathbf{T}$:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla \cdot \mathbf{T} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial t} = \mathbf{f},
        \end{equation}
        where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momentum density and $\mathbf{f}$ is the force density acting on the system. The electromagnetic fields also carry \textbf{angular momentum}, and its conservation is described by the angular momentum density $\mathbf{L}$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{\partial \mathbf{L}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{M} = \boldsymbol{\tau},
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\mathbf{M}$ is the angular momentum flux density tensor, and $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{f}$ represents the torque density acting on the system.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Time-reversal symmetry:} Maxwell's equations remain valid if we reverse the direction of time ($t\to-t$). It can be shown that under time-reversal symmetry
                                                the fields transform as $\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$,  $\bm{\mathcal{D}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to\bm{\mathcal{D}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$,
                                                 $\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to-\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$, and $\bm{\mathcal{B}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to-\bm{\mathcal{B}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$, while the current density and charge density transform as 
                                                 $\bm{\mathcal{J}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to-\bm{\mathcal{J}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$ and $\bm{\mathcal{\rho}}(\mathbf{r}, t)\to\bm{\mathcal{\rho}}(\mathbf{r}, -t)$, respectively \cite{reciprocity}.
                                                 Applying these transformations to Maxwell's equations in Eqs. \eqref{eq:curlE_freq}-\eqref{eq:divB_freq} shows that the equations remain invariant under time-reversal. This 
                                                 symmetry can be extended by considering \textbf{Parity-time (PT) symmetry}, which combines time-reversal with spatial inversion ($\mathbf{r}\to-\mathbf{r}$) and is satisfied for materials with
                                                 $\varepsilon(\mathbf{r}) = \varepsilon^*(-\mathbf{r})$ and $\mu(\mathbf{r}) = \mu^*(-\mathbf{r})$. There are however some situations where time-reversal symmetry and/or PT symmetry is broken, 
                                                 such as in the presence of non-reciprocal materials (e.g., magneto-optical materials) or materials with optical losses \cite{ownpub0}.VERIFY AND CITE SOME PT SYMMETRY PAPER.
        
    \item \textbf{Reciprocity:} In an optical system the source and the detector of electromagnetic fields can be interchanged without changing the physical situation. Let's consider a system where two volumes $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ 
    have two current densities $\mathbf{j}_1$ and $\mathbf{j}_2$ that create the fields $\mathbf{E}_1$, $\mathbf{H}_1$ and $\mathbf{E}_2$, $\mathbf{H}_2$ respectively. Using the Lorentz recirpocity theorem one can show that \cite{novotny}:      
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{\Omega_1} \mathbf{E}_1^* \cdot \mathbf{j}_2 = \int_{\Omega_2}  \mathbf{E}_2^* \cdot \mathbf{j}_1 d\mathbf{r} = 0.
    \end{equation}
    For losless media this is equivalent to time-reversal symmetry, but for lossy systems reciprocity still remains valid \cite{Carminati:98}. Reciprocity is a very useful property of Maxwell's equations, as it can be used to 
    greatly simplify some formulations of inverse design problems [CITE LASER PAPER].

\section{The finite element method in electromagnetics}

(CHECK IANS THESIS)

The weak form of the wave equation can be written as (CHECK CHATGPT):
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} \nabla \times \mathbf{E} \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf{v} - k^2 \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{v} \quad \forall \mathbf{v} \in V,
\end{equation}
The weak form can be discretized by using the finite-element method. An example is shown in Figure YY, 
where we have discretized the two-dimensional domain in Figure XX into a set of triangular edge elements. 
The edge elements, or Nedelec elements (CITE), of first kind are a natural choice for the electromagnetic 
wave equation, as they are divergence-free and enforce the continuity of the tangential electric field 
across the element boundaries, which is a natural boundary condition for Maxwell's equations 
\footnote{For 2D models where the field discontinuity at the material interfaces 
is in the out-of-plane direction (e.g., Publication 3), one can use Lagrange element without 
exciting spurious modes.}. In Figure YY
we show the structure of a Nedelec element alongside a quiver plot of the shape function one of the edges.
Using the shape functions we can calculate the contribution of the different elements to the weak form of the
wave equation, which can be assembled into a system of equations in the strong form:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{K} \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{F},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{K}$ is the stiffness matrix, $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the source
 term. In the case of eigenvalue problems the source term is zero ($\mathbf{F}=0$), and the system of equations 
that needs to be solved is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \left(\mathbf{K} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right) \mathbf{E} =  \mathbf{0},
\end{equation}

Note that the stiffness matrix is symmetric indefinite, restricting the use of iterative solvers (e.g., Cholesky factorization, Krylov method) to solve the system of equations. Instead LU factorization is a common choice for direct solvers.

Symmetry conditions can be applied to reduce the computational
cost of the solutions by employing perfect electric conductor (PEC) and perfect magnetic 
conductor (PMC) boundary conditions. The PEC boundary condition
imposes symmetry for magnetic fields and antisymmetry for electric fields and electric 
currents, by setting the tangential component of the electric field to zero: $\mathbf{n}\times \mathbf{E} = 0$ .
The PMC boundary condition imposes symmetry for electric fields and antisymmetry for magnetic fields
by setting the normal component of the magnetic field to zero: $\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{H} = 0$.

\section{Beyond single-physics -- coupled optical systems}

Coupled multi-physics systems are physical systems where the solution of one of the physical 
problem depends on the solution of another physical problem. Let's consider that the two
problems can be described by linear partial differential equations, where the first problem
is described by the equation $\mathcal{L}_1 [\mathbf{u}]= \mathbf{a}$ and the second problem is described by the 
equation $\mathcal{L}_2 [\mathbf{w}]= \mathbf{b}$.

 If this relation is unidirectional
we call it \textbf{weak coupling}, and if the relation is bidirectional we call it 
\textbf{strong coupling}.

In weaky coupled systems, both physical problems can be solved independently in a seggregated 
manner, where the solution of one problem is used in the the other problem.

In strongly coupled systems, the physical problems are solved simultaneously.

Differentiate between weak and strong coupling.

\section{Topology optimization of multiphysics systems}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{clr}
    \max\limits_{\xi} & \Phi(\xi, \mathbf{u}) & \text { (Objective function) } \\
    \text { s.t. } & \mathbf{S}_i(\xi, \mathbf{u})-\mathbf{f}_i=0 \quad \forall i \in\left[1, N_S\right] & \text { (State equations) } \\
    & c_j(\xi, \mathbf{u}) \leq 0 \quad \forall j \in\left[1, N_c\right] & \text { (Inequality constraints) } \\
    & \xi_{\text {min }} \leq \xi \leq \xi_{\text {max }} & \text { (Box constraints) }
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

The optimization problem is solved using the algorithm of the Method of Moving
Asymptotes (MMA) (CITE) and Globally Convergent Method of Moving Ssymptotes (GCMMA) (CITE).

\subsection{From densities to material properties}

To regularize the optimization and introduce a weak sense of geometric length scale, we filter
the density field using a filter operation. The filtered density can be calculated using a 
convolution-based filter operation (CITE)
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    & \tilde{\xi}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{B}_{e, h}} w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_k\right) A_k \xi_k}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{B}_{e, h}} w\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_k\right) A_k}, \\
    & w(\mathbf{r})=\left\{r_f-|\mathbf{r}| \quad \forall|\mathbf{r}| \leq r_f, \quad r_f \geq 0, \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Omega\right.\,,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $A_k$ is the area of the kth element, and $\mathcal{B}_{e, h}$ denotes the
$h^\text{th}$ set of finite elements whose center point is within a filter radius $r_f$ of the
$h^\text{th}$ element. One can also filter by solving a Helmholtz-type PDE (CITE):
\begin{equation}
    -\left(\frac{r_f}{2 \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 \nabla \tilde{\xi}+\tilde{\xi}=\xi
\end{equation}
The filter operation is followed by a smoothed Heaviside threshold:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\tilde{\xi}}=\frac{\tanh (\beta \cdot \eta)+\tanh (\beta \cdot(\tilde{\xi}-\eta))}{\tanh (\beta \cdot \eta)+\tanh (\beta \cdot(1-\eta))}, \quad \beta \in[1, \infty[, \eta \in[0,1],
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ and $\eta$ control the threshold sharpness and value, respectively.

The physical field cna be interpolated to the filtered density field using a material interpolation.
In multi-physics problems, we will have one material interpolation for each different physical problem
\footnote{If the problem stem from the same physics (e.g., solving two optical problems), the material interpolation can be re-used.}.
In general, the material interpolation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \zeta(\bar{\tilde{\xi}})=\zeta_0+\bar{\tilde{\xi}}^p\left(\zeta_1-\zeta_0\right)
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$ is the material property, $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ are the material properties of the void and solid, respectively, and $p$
is a penalization factor (usually, $p=3$ for compliance optimization and $p$=1 for other problems). Note that for some
special cases, like optical optimization problems with metals, it is benefitial to employ a non-linear material interpolation.

Do it in such a way that it works for multiphysics.

\subsection{Adjoint sensitivity analysis}

(CHECK NIELS THESIS)

The adjoint sensitivity analysis is used to efficiently calculate the gradient of the objective function with 
respect to the design variables. In this thesis, we use the adjoint sensitivity analysis  in the context of 
multi-physics problems, where multiple complex-valued PDE are solved. Let us rewrite the FOM by adding the residual
of the state equation and its complex conjugate, multiplied by the Lagrange multipliers, $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_{i+N}$, 
respectively:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\Phi} =\Phi + \sum^N_i \left[ \lambda_{i}^{\top}\left(\mathbf{S}_i \mathbf{u}^*_i -\mathbf{f}_i\right) + 
    \lambda_{i+N}^{\dagger}\left(\mathbf{S}_{i}^* \mathbf{u}^*_i -\mathbf{f}_i^*\right) \right]
\end{equation}

\section{A practical note on computational implementation}

Using first order edge, or nodal, elements a rule of thumb is to include at least 10 elements per wavelength.

Discuss direct vs iterative solvers, discuss condition number of the system.
Sparsity, symmetry, definitiness
Discuss the practical implementation, with COMSOL and other means (Fenics, gridap, etc).
Check Niels, Ian's thesis, and other references.
